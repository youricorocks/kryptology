### GG20 bench

NOTE 1: these values are collected for the worst case scenario, when the next signer is waiting for the previous signer
before processing it's own signing. Also, for each step signing is processed for everyone with everyone case (where len(everyone) = Threshold).

NOTE 2: there are cases with the full threshold value. Such thresholds is somewhat redundant for real world. In the real world
you can set the threshold to smaller values: 2*count/3 + 1, count/2, ...
